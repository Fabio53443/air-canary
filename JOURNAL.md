In this session I've started outlining the main idea behind the project and i've started to understand some basic components to use and a very rough BOM

## Air Canary 
The general idea is to create a better, open-source, version of the [Birdie](https://www.birdie.design/products/birdie-yellow). 
It would have a similar shape and the same base idea (the Canary going upside down when air quality worsens) but it would integrate an e-ink display to display some useful information. 
The main controller would be an ESP8266, and it could integrate with a web app to monitor air quality statistics (optional) 
The main sensor would be the Sensiron SCD41-D-R2 on a custom pub with the ESP; 
The body would be made of a base with the main components and the display, and the bird piece connected to a motor that lets it rotate when triggered.
